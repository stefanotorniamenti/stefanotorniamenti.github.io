Iâ€™m a postdoctoral researcher at Heidelberg University, working on the topics of stellar dynamics, black holes, and gravitational-wave astronomy. 
I'm curious to understand how these black holes interact with their surroundings and influence the evolution of their stellar cluster. Also, I investigate the formation of gravitational waves in dense stellar environments.


I completed my PhD in Astronomy (April 2023) at the University of Padova, Italy, under the supervision of Prof. Michela Mapelli in the [DEMOBLACK](https://demoblack.com/) group.
Before that, I carried out my Bachelor and Master in Physics at the University of Milan, Italy, under the supervision of Prof. Giuseppe Bertin.
