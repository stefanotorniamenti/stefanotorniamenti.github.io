Iâ€™m a Humboldt Research Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, working on the topics of stellar dynamics, black holes and gravitational-wave astronomy. 
I'm curious to understand how these black holes interact with their surroundings and influence the evolution of their stellar cluster. Also, I investigate the formation of gravitational waves in dense stellar environments.


I completed my PhD in Astronomy in April 2023 at the University of Padova, Italy, with the thesis: Unveiling the dynamics of young star clusters and their black hole
population.
Before that, I carried out my Bachelor and Master in Physics at the University of Milan, Italy.
